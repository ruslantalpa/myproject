# subZero GraphQL/REST API Starter Kit

Base project and tooling for authoring **data API**
backends with [subZero](https://subzero.cloud/).

## Runs Anywhere
Run subZero stack as a hassle-free service ([free plan](https://subzero.cloud/pricing.html) available) or deploy it yourself anywhere using binary and docker distributions.

## Features

✓ Out of the box GraphQL/REST endpoints created by reflection over a PostgreSQL schema<br>
✓ Authentication using email/password or using 3rd party OAuth 2.0 providers (google/facebook/github preconfigured) <br>
✓ Cross-platform development on macOS, Windows or Linux inside [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)<br>
✓ [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database schema boilerplate with authentication and authorization flow<br>
✓ Debugging and live code reloading (sql/configs/lua) functionality using [subzero-cli](https://github.com/subzerocloud/subzero-cli)<br>
✓ Full migration management (migration files are automatically created) through [subzero-cli](https://github.com/subzerocloud/subzero-cli)<br>
✓ SQL unit test using [pgTAP](http://pgtap.org/)<br>
✓ Integration tests with [SuperTest / Mocha](https://github.com/visionmedia/supertest)<br>
✓ Community support on [Slack](https://slack.subzero.cloud/)<br>
✓ Uses [PostgREST+](https://subzero.cloud/postgrest-plus.html) that supports features like aggregate functions (group by), window functions, SSL, HTTP2 and many more<br>
✓ Scriptable proxy level caching using nginx [proxy_cache](http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#proxy_cache) or Redis<br>

## Installation 

### Prerequisites
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [subzero-cli](https://github.com/subzerocloud/subzero-cli#install)

### Create a New Project
subzero-cli provides you with a `base-project` command that lets you create a new project structure:

```bash
subzero base-project

? Enter the directory path where you want to create the project .
? Choose the starter kit (Use arrow keys)
❯ subzero-starter-kit (REST & GraphQL) 
  postgrest-starter-kit (REST) 
```

After the files have been created, you can bring up your application (API).
In the root folder of application, run the docker-compose command

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

The API server will become available at the following endpoints:

- Frontend [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)
- REST [http://localhost:8080/rest/](http://localhost:8080/rest/)
- GraphQL Simple Schema [http://localhost:8080/graphql/simple/](http://localhost:8080/graphql/simple/)
- GraphQL Relay Schema [http://localhost:8080/graphql/relay/](http://localhost:8080/graphql/relay/)

Try a simple request

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/rest/todos?select=id,todo
```

Try a GraphQL query in the integrated [GraphiQL IDE](http://localhost:8080/explore/graphql.html)

```
{
  todos{
    id
    todo
  }
}
```

## Development workflow and debugging

Execute `subzero dashboard` in the root of your project.<br />
After this step you can view the logs of all the stack components (SQL queries will also be logged) and
if you edit a sql/conf file in your project, the changes will immediately be applied.


## Unit and integration tests

The starter kit comes with a testing infrastructure setup.
You can write pgTAP tests that run directly in your database, useful for testing the logic that resides in your database (user privileges, Row Level Security, stored procedures).
Integration tests are written in JavaScript.

Here is how you run them locally

```bash
yarn install         # Install test dependencies
yarn test            # Run all tests (db, rest, graphql)
yarn test_db         # Run pgTAP tests
yarn test_rest       # Run rest integration tests
yarn test_graphql    # Run graphql integration tests
```

All the test are also executed on on git push (on GitHub) 

## Deployment
The deployment is done using a [GitHub Actions script](.github/workflows/test_deploy.yaml).
The deploy action will push your migrations to the production database using sqitch and the static files with scp.
The deploy step is triggered only on git tags in the form of `v1.2`

Note that the deploy action pushes to production the database migrations (db/migrations/) not the current database schema definition (db/src/) so you'll need execute `subzero migrations init --with-roles` before the first deploy and when iterating, you'll create new migrations using `subzero migration add <migration_name>`

You'll also need to configure the following "secrets" for your github deploy action
```
PRODUCTION_DB_MASTER_USER
PRODUCTION_DB_MASTER_PASSWORD
PRODUCTION_DB_HOST
PRODUCTION_DB_PORT
PRODUCTION_DB_NAME
SFTP_USER
SFTP_PASSWORD
SUBZERO_PASSWORD
SUBZERO_EMAIL
SUBZERO_PASSWORD
SUBZERO_APPLICATION_ID
```

While the deploy action is written for subzero.cloud (`DEPLOY_TARGET: subzerocloud`) it can easily be adapted for other deploy targets that run the subzero stack
